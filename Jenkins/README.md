## Why is Jenkins important and why do we use it?
Jenkins is **open source**, this means it is free to use and the code is available for anyone to edit. This means the community can contribute to developing new functionality within the software which results in there being over a thousand different **plugins** which can be installed to enhance its capability. One of the biggest benefits of Jenkins is easy environment configuration and user-friendly interface.
